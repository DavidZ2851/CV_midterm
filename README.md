# CV_midterm
The ObjectDection is to detect multiple objects and their distance. I included the code using the camera set up and the depth_frame, 
but I haven't tested on it since I don't have the camera (intel d435i). I used two camera to detect the object's distance based on the
shared video in the CV slide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3LOey68Xpg&t=1258s. I also tried to write the angleOffset in the second problem.
